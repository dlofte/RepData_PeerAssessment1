This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

###Loading in the data

```{r}
setwd("~/R/reproResearch/RepData_PeerAssessment1")#on pc
setwd("~/Documents/RepData_PeerAssessment1")#on mac

unzip('activity.zip')
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(activity)
head(activity,20)
summary(activity)
activity[activity$date == "2012-10-01",] 

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
activity[,2] <- as.Date(activity$date)
summary(activity[,2])
time <- paste(activity$date, activity$interval)
time[1]
```

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.
1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
library(dplyr)
group_by(activity,date, interval)
summary(group_by(activity,date))
byDay <- summarize(group_by(activity, date), totalSteps=sum(steps))
head(byDay)
hist(byDay$totalSteps)
plot(byDay$date, byDay$totalSteps)


meanByDay <- summarize(group_by(activity, date), meanSteps = mean(steps)) 
medianByDay <- summarize(group_by(activity, date), medianSteps = median(steps)) 
summary(medianByDay)
str(meanByDay)
median(activity$steps, na.rm = T)

results <- left_join(byDay, meanByDay)
results <- left_join(results, medianByDay)
results


byInterval <-summarize(group_by(activity, interval ), averageSteps = mean(steps, na.rm = T))
head(byInterval, 20)
plot(byInterval$interval, byInterval$averageSteps, type = 'l')

byInterval[byInterval$averageSteps == max(byInterval$averageSteps),]
?plot
```
