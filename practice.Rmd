This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

###Loading in the data

```{r}
setwd("~/R/reproResearch/RepData_PeerAssessment1")

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(activity)
head(activity,20)
summary(activity)
activity[activity$date == "2012-10-01",] 

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
activity[,2] <- as.Date(activity$date)
times < POSIXactivity$interval
time <- paste(activity$date, activity$interval)
time[1]
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
'''{r}
library(dplyr)
byDay <- summarise(group_by(act2, date, time, interval), steps = mean(steps))
str(byDay)
head(stepsbyDay)
plot(byDay$time, byDay$steps, type='l')
plot(byDay$interval, byDay$steps, fill = T)
mean(byDay$steps, rm.na = TRUE)
$as.Date
?plot
